• SNR, is a measure of the strength of the desired signal relative to 
background noise (undesired signal).
A signal-to-noise ratio over 0 dB indicates that the signal level is greater than the 
noise level. The higher the ratio, the better the signal quality.
• An envelope detector can be used to demodulate a previously modulated 
signal by removing all high frequency components of the signal. E.D is used 
for TC and can’t be used with SC so it can’t be used with DSBSC nor NBFM 
• Coherent detection is suitable for any type of modulation
• NBFM is a FM signal that only uses a small portion of a normal FM channel
